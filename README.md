# ASAP (Auto Steam Achievement Progressor)

ASAP is a project designed to automate the process of earning Steam achievements in a realistic manner. Unlike tools like SAM (Steam Achievement Manager), which unlock all achievements at once, ASAP enables you to progressively unlock achievements in a logical sequence and at appropriate intervals, autonomously.

**NOT YET FUNCTIONAL, WIP**
